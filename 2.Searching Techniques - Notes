A) Linear Search ( Time Complexity is - O(n) ) 

   1)  Going one by one sequentially 


B) Binary Search ( Divide and Conquer, Time Complexity - O(log n)  )

        Approach is diving the list into smaller list . How do we do that?

        1) Sort the List ( it is better to stay organized ) 
        2) Find the number in the middle
        3) Discard numbers to the left or right depending on items to the left or right 
           Therby search only in the remaining list making a smaller list.
